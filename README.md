# Anthropic-HR-audit
I conducted an audit on Anthropic's HR pipeline for the "Research Engineer / Scientist, Alignment Science" role to see if their autofilters block outliers who actually align with their values. 

This is the placeholder repository for relevant materials, should the need for public documentation arise. Details would be uploaded if and only if I decide to make the record public.

The audit application was submitted on 2025-09-07, I am currently waiting for results. If unanswered after 6 weeks(by 2025-10-19), I will assume it was ignored or autofiltered out, and will signal a failure that warrents further attention.
