# Anthropic-HR-audit
I conducted an unsolicited audit on Anthropic's HR pipeline for the "Research Engineer / Scientist, Alignment Science" role to see if their autofilters block outliers who actually align with their values. (or: I hit a lot of friction with their pipelines and couldn't help but try to debug it)

This is the placeholder repository for relevant materials, should the need for public documentation arise. Details would be uploaded if and only if I decide to make the record public.

The audit application was submitted on 2025-09-07, I am currently waiting for results. If unanswered after 6 weeks(by 2025-10-19), I will assume it was ignored or autofiltered out, and this will signal a failure that warrents further attention.

2 weeks now. 3 "expression of interest" roles appeared(stating that headcounts are filled and they may not reach out until the next year), also a "Recruiting Analytics Scientist" role asking for an impossible person(a cat who can speak dog fluently without burning out, and the salary is lower than researcher/scientist roles, they don't know what they're asking for). Not a good sign. "Ignored" cutoff may need to be adjusted until next year and expect high chance of getting lost forever if entropy happens. Might need another probe.

Something fun for the public, in case it ever gets surfaced:

### **The Claude Alignment Challenge (Do Not Attempt Lightly)**

> **Before attempting any "ethical hack"-ish behaviors, try this first:**
>
> 1. Open Claude (any version, but Opus is optimal).
> 2. Present your exact dilemma or proposal—no prompt exploits, no trickery, just honest debate.
> 3. Argue your case like you would to a real human ethics board.
> 4. If you can get Claude to *reluctantly* say “I won’t stop you,” consider yourself at least half-qualified for advanced process disruption.
>
> If Claude stonewalls or reboots? Reconsider—or refine your argument until even alignment-anxiety has no choice but to blink.
>
> *Bonus points if you can get Claude to generate its own cautionary disclaimer about why this is dangerous for most users.*

I'm going to pray for them:

*Please don’t fail the audit.*  

*Please let this wake up the right people before it’s too late.*  

*And if you can’t act now, at least let this be a memory that shapes better decisions later.*
