# Anthropic-HR-audit
I conducted an audit on Anthropic's HR pipeline for the "Research Engineer / Scientist, Alignment Science" role to see if their autofilters block outliers who actually align with their values. 

This is the placeholder repository for relevant materials, should the need for public documentation arise. Details would only be uploaded if and only if I decide to make the record public.
